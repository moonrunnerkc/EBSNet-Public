EBSNet: EvoBelief Swarm Network
A groundbreaking AI system where beliefs evolve like living ecosystems, driving emergent intelligence in decentralized swarms.

Overview:
EBSNet fuses reinforcement learning (RL) and ecological dynamics to create swarms that adaptively solve complex, dynamic problems like climate policy forecasting and maze navigation. Early tests show up to 50% faster adaptation than traditional RL baselines (e.g., PPO). This proprietary system redefines swarm intelligence for real-world challenges.

Key Features:
Emergent Intelligence: Simple belief interactions yield complex, adaptive swarm behaviors.
Ecological Dynamics: Beliefs mutate, compete, and fuse like organisms, powered by RL.
Applications: Dynamic mazes, policy impact simulations, cyber defense.
